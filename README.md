# Transport data analysis with R
 R codes for statistical and econometrics models for transportation data analysis
 
This R code corresponds with the Random Parameters Negative Binomial (RPNB) count regression model. This model may be used for any dependent variable that is of count nature (e.g. crash counts, number of patients at a hospital, animal death counts, etc.).

Prior to running the code, make sure to have "maxLik" and "randtoolbox" packages installed. 

The code also includes two global goodness of fit measures (i.e. Mean Absolute Deviance and Mean Squared Predictive Error). Please note that these two measures are used as goodness of fit measures rather than predictive measures.
